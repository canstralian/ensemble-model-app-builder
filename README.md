ðŸ‘€ **Enhanced Multi-Model AI-Powered App Builder for Streamlit and Gradio Applications**

Discover a more intuitive and seamless way to create Streamlit and Gradio applications with our Hugging Face Space. Harness the combined prowess of several large language models, letting you develop interactive web tools swiftly and with minimal coding experience.

## Overview

Leverage this tool to automatically generate Python code tailored for either Streamlit or Gradio apps. Our system integrates the capabilities of the Gemini Pro 2.0, Salesforce/codet5-small, and bigscience/T0_3B models to craft your code. Begin by picking a predefined task or entering a custom directive.

Originally conceptualized by:
**Louie F. Cervantes, M.Eng (Information Engineering)**
West Visayas State University
This iteration, refined and expanded by **WhackTheJacker**, maximizes the utility of multiple models to boost code generation accuracy and variety.

## Key Features

* **Advanced Multi-Model Code Generation:** Utilizes Gemini Pro 2.0, Salesforce/codet5-small, and bigscience/T0_3B for enhanced and reliable code synthesis.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simply describe your desired application functionality, and let the AI handle the rest.
* **Support for Streamlit and Gradio:** Opt for the framework that best suits your requirements.
* **Efficient Prototyping:** Condense your development timeline with rapid code generation and iterative features.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **App Description:** Provide a clear and concise outline of the application you wish to construct.
2. **Framework Selection:** Decide whether to generate a Streamlit or Gradio application.
3. **Initiate Code Generation:** Press the "Generate" button and watch the AI draft your Python script.
4. **Customize and Validate:** Examine the code output and adjust as required.
5. **Deployment or Execution:** Run the code on a local setup or deploy using services like Streamlit Sharing or Hugging Face Spaces.

## Model Summary

- **Gemini Pro 2.0:** Offers extensive code generation and adept natural language interpretation.
- **Salesforce/codet5-small:** Specializes in refining code and enhancing output quality.
- **bigscience/T0_3B:** Excels in understanding natural language commands and execution.
